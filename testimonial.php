<p class="quote2">As a life long student of voice, I have studied with many teachers over the years. It was important for me to diversify my education because the voice is so complex and difficult to master. I would find great teachers, study with them for a little while, and then feel like I had extracted all I could from their technique. When I started to study with Shane, it was apparent to me almost instantly that I had found an instructor who possessed such a vast set of technical skills and knowledge that I could settle in with him for the long haul. Since studying with Shane my understanding of the instrument I thought I knew so well has deepened, my confidence in my abilities has grown, and my overall vocal health has taken a huge leap up. He has spent the time showing me all the important nuances of my voice to not only see the big picture, but to focus on the little details that make it all work as well. No matter your technical ability level, genre of music, or experience, having Shane as your instructor is the absolute smartest decision you can make. Do not underestimate that you have God given talent and so therefore you donâ€™t need a coach. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is no great talent anywhere in this world that is not backed somewhere in their life by an amazing coach, and Shane is yours. </p>

<p class="quote2">My daughter has been taking voice with Shane for a little over one year. Throughout these months, she tells me how her knowledge of singing has grown tremendously, and it has definitely showed. Shane has also helped her learn piano, and this has allowed her to become more creative and dedicated with music. Shane is an incredible teacher, and gave my daughter confidence, knowledge and an understanding of music. He is a very welcoming and comfortable person to be around and makes an excellent role model for all of his students. His talent with singing, piano, and teaching in general is amazing and any person would be lucky to have him as their teacher. </p>
